//! Remote music playback: the music control (a *controller*) drives a
//! *player* on another device over a websocket (`/api/ws/player`), or the
//! server's own sound card (the server player, cargo feature `local-audio`).
//!
//! The [`PlayerHub`] keeps the shared state: the connected players, the
//! active one, the cued song and the volume. Only the active player gets
//! playback commands; every player gets the songs coming up, so it can load
//! them in advance. "Weiter" in the timeplan cues the next song but never
//! starts it: the operator starts the music.
//!
//! A player that loses its connection stays for [`RECONNECT_GRACE`], marked
//! disconnected, and comes back with the same id (`?id=`): it keeps its
//! active status and gets the volume and the cue again. Commands sent while it
//! is away are lost. A controller can remove it before that.
//!
//! For award ceremonies the controllers share a queue of act songs, played on
//! demand: on the active player through the hub, or by a music control in
//! its own browser.
